Record sightings of Asian hornets are raising fears of catastrophic
consequences for the UK's bee populations for years to come.
The invasive hornets are wreaking havoc in mainland Europe and threaten
to get a foothold in the UK, with nests found in East Sussex, Kent, Devon
and Dorset.
The insects feed on native bees and wasps, damaging biodiversity.
The warning comes as leading scientists release a global report into the
threats caused by invasive species. They say the alien invaders play a role
in 60% of animal and plant extinctions.And the economic costs have risen 
to more than Â£300bn ($380bn) a year across the world.
