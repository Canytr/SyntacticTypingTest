### Installation

1. Clone the repo

### Built With CMake

This project leverages the power of Qt, a comprehensive cross-platform C++ framework, to provide a rich and intuitive user interface for effective code reviews. Additionally, CMake orchestrates the build process, ensuring seamless integration and ease of compilation.

CMake reads the CMakeLists.txt file and creates makefiles from it. This means that after we run CMake, we need to run make to actually build our project. We'll do this from a separate directory so the binaries don't clutter up our source directory.

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
